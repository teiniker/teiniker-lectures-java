Sympathy For The Devil (Song by The Rolling Stones)

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh, yeah
Ah, what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww, yeah
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh, yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww, yeah
(Uh, get down heavy!)
Pleased to meet you, hope you'll guess my name
Aww, yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game
Mmm, yeah
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
Mmm, yeah
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
Mmm, yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Mmm, mean it, get down
Woo-hoo!
Aww, yeah
Get on down
Oh, yeah
Ba-bum-bum, ba-ba-bum
Ah, yeah
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
Tell me, honey, can you guess my name?
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
I'll tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
All right
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo
Ah yeah
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo
Ah, yes, what's my name?
Tell me, baby, ah what's my name?
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name?
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo
Ah, yeah
What's my name?
