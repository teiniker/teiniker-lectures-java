Exercise: File Handling - File List
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a class called "DirectoryAnalyzer" which collects information about the
content of a given directory.

Here is the directory to analyze:
$ ll data
    -rwxr-xr-- 1 student student 16703 Apr 11 21:19 logo.png
    -rw-r--r-- 1 student student  2240 Apr 11 22:53 song.txt
    drwxr-xr-x 2 student student  4096 May  7 20:34 tmp

Implement the following methods:

A) List<Path> getListOfFiles(String directory)
    Use the classes "Paths" and "Files" to generate a List<Path> objects.

B) List<String> generateFileList(List<Path> fileList)
    Extract information from each "Path" object and generate a String out of it.
    Example: "File: logo.png - Size: 16703 bytes"
    Collect these Strings in a List<String>.

Tip: Wrap all checked "IOException"s into runtime "ServiceException"s.
