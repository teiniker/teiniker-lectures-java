# Example: Clone a Remote Repository

This example shows how a remote repository can be used.

## Clone a GitHub Repository 

A GitHub repository can be visited via a Web browser. We can review all
source files and read documentation.
To download a copy of this repository we use the **clone** operation.

We start by modifying a file from the versioned project.
```
$ mkdir sandbox
$ cd sandbox
$ git clone https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-java
```

Note that every change in the repository can be transferred to 
the local repository by a simple update.
```
$ git pull
```
