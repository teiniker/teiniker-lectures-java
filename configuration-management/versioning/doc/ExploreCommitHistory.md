# Explore the Commit History 

The `git log` command is used to **display the commit history** in a Git repository. 
It shows a chronological list of commits, starting from the most recent commit and going back in time to the initial commit.

By default, `git log` displays the following information for each commit:
* Commit Hash (SHA): A unique identifier for each commit.
* Author: The name and email address of the person who made the commit.
* Date: The date and time when the commit was made.
* Commit Message: The message provided by the author to describe the changes made in the commit.

```
$ git log

The `git log` command provides various options that allow you to customize the output and filter the commit history based on specific criteria. Here are some commonly used options:
* `--oneline`: Condenses the commit information into a single line, showing only the commit hash and the commit message.
* `--graph`: Displays a text-based ASCII graph representing the commit history, with branches and merges.
* `--author=<pattern>`: Filters the commit history to show only the commits made by the specified author(s) based on the provided pattern.
* `--since=<date>`: Shows commits made since the specified date.
* `--until=<date>`: Shows commits made until the specified date.
* `--grep=<pattern>`: Filters the commit history to show only the commits with commit messages matching the specified pattern.


_Example: Show each commit in one line_\
The `git log --oneline` command is used to display a **condensed version of the commit history** in a Git repository. It provides a simplified output that shows each commit on a single line, making it easier to scan through the history quickly.

When we run `git log --oneline`, the following information is displayed for each commit:
* Commit Hash (SHA): A shortened version of the commit hash, usually the first 7 characters.
* Commit Message: The commit message provided by the author.
```
$ git log --oneline

_Example: Show only tag-related information_\
To show the **tag messages** in the Git history, we can use the `git log` command with the `--decorate` option. The `--decorate` option adds additional information, such as tags and branch names, to the commit messages displayed by `git log`.
If we want to see **only the tag-related information**, you can combine git log with the `--simplify-by-decoration` option:

```
$ git log --decorate --simplify-by-decoration

_Example: Show the files committed in each Git commit_\
To see the **files committed in each Git commit**, we can use the `git log --stat` command. This command provides a summary of the files that were modified in each commit along with some additional statistics.

The output of `git log --stat` will show you the commit hash, author, date, and commit message as well as a summary of the files modified in each commit. The summary includes the file name, the number of lines added and deleted, and the total number of changes.
```
$ git log --stat
