# API Documentation

A **larger software system** will be **decomposed** into smaller subsystems.

![Sub-System](figures/SubSystem.png)

A subsystem is technically defined by **public interfaces and classes** of a package.


The **Application Programming Interface (API)** of a subsystem is a set of by public macros, operations, classes and types.

There is nothing quite so helpful and satisfying as a **well-documented public API**. 

The API documentation defines the **contract** between the **subsystem** and **its clients**. 

If we write a public API, we should also write a good API documentation using 
a tool like **JavaDoc** or **Doxygen**.
