Exercise: Date (Class, Types, Operators)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a "Date" class which has the integer fields "day", "month", and
"year".

A) Read-Only Properties
Implement the fields "day", "month", and "year" read-only, which means
that you create private fields and implement only getter methods.

B) Integer Constructor
Implement a constructor with the following parameters:
    public Date(int day, int month, int year)

C) Object Methods
Because this is a data class, implement the Object methods: "toString()",
"equals()" and "hashCode()".

D) String Constructor
Implement a constructor with the following parameter:
    public Date(String date)
Here you have to split the string around the "\\." characters into sub-strings
and convert them into integer values.

E) boolean isLeapYear()
Implement a "isLeapYear()" method which determines if a given year is a leap year.
Rules for calculating a leap year:
    i) If the year is divisible by 4, it is potentially a Leap year
    ii) If the year is divisible by 100, then it is NOT a leap year
    iii) If the year is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year

F) public boolean isValid()
Implement a "isValid()" method which validates the stored values for "day", "month",
and "year".
Constraints:
    year >= 1
    1 <= month <=12
    day: 28, 29, 30 or 31 depending on the month and if t is a leap year

Tip: Use "DateTest" to verify your implementations.

Tip: Try to implement your own solution first before looking at the model solution.
     Only look if you get stuck or want to compare your solution with the model solution.
