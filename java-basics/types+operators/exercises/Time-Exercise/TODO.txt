Exercise: Time (Class, Types, Operators)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a "Time" class which has the integer fields "hours", "minutes", and
"seconds".

A) Read-Only Properties
Implement the fields "hours", "minutes", and "seconds" read-only, which means
that you create private fields and implement only getter methods.

B) Integer Constructor
Implement a constructor with the following parameters:
    public Time(int hours, int minutes, int seconds)

C) Object Methods
Because this is a data class, implement the Object methods: "toString()",
"equals()" and "hashCode()".

D) String Constructor
Implement a constructor with the following parameter:
    public Time(String time)
Here you have to split the string around the ":" characters into sub-strings
and convert them into integer values.

E) public int toSeconds()
Implement a "toSeconds()" method which converts the stored time into seconds.

F) public Time fromSeconds(long totalSeconds)
Implement a "fromSeconds()" method which takes seconds and converts these into
a new Time instance.

Tip: Use "TimeTest" to verify your implementations.

Tip: Try to implement your own solution first before looking at the model solution.
     Only look if you get stuck or want to compare your solution with the model solution.
