# Exceptions 

Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's instructions. 
They are **objects that wrap an error event** that occurred within a method and contain 
information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when 
the error occurred. 

Java uses exceptions to **manage errors and other exceptional events** and provides a 
robust framework for handling them.

## Types of Exceptions
Java categorizes exceptions into two main types, based on how they are checked by the compiler:

* **Checked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that must be either caught or declared 
    in the method where they occur. They extend the `Exception` class. Checked exceptions 
    are used for **recoverable conditions**; the compiler ensures that these exceptions 
    are either surrounded with a `try-catch` block or declared with a `throws` clause in 
    the method signature.

* **Unchecked Exceptions**: These exceptions include `RuntimeException` and its subclasses, 
    and `Error` and its subclasses. Unchecked exceptions represent problems that are typically 
    the result of **programming errors**, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. 
    `Error` is used for serious errors from which recovery is not expected, like `OutOfMemoryError`. 
    Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in a method's throws clause.

## Exception Handling

Java provides several mechanisms for handling exceptions:

* **try-catch Block**: The `try-catch` block is used to catch exceptions. The code 
    that might throw an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the `catch` 
    block is used to handle the exception that occurs. 
    We can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

* **finally Block**: The `finally` block is optional and follows the `try-catch` blocks. 
    It **contains code that is always executed**, regardless of whether an exception was 
    thrown or caught. It's typically used for cleanup activities.

* **throws Keyword**: The `throws` keyword is used in a method's signature to declare 
    that the method might throw certain exceptions. 
    The calling method must handle these exceptions.

* **throw Keyword**: The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception, 
    either a newly instantiated one or one that was caught.

Understanding and properly using exceptions is crucial for building robust, error-resistant 
Java applications.
