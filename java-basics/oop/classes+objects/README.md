# Classes and Objects


> A **class** in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines 
> a set of properties (known as attributes or fields) and behaviors (known as methods) 
> that the objects created from the class can have. 
> Classes serve as the fundamental building blocks of any Java application.


> An **object** is an instance of a class. When we create an object from a class, 
> we are creating an entity that has the structure and behaviors defined by that class. 
> Objects are the actual entities that exist in memory and can be manipulated during 
> the execution of a program. Each object has its own set of attributes (also known as 
> state), and it can perform actions through its methods (also known as behavior).
